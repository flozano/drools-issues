# Drools issues


This project is a small gradle build intended to reproduce drools-related bugs and/or understand drools behaviours.


# Notes

HTML report by gradle is not showing test name because of this issue ( https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/5975 ), as the tests are parameterized.

In Eclipse you can properly see the name of the failing test.
